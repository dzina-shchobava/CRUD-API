### Implementation details
1. Endpoint `api/users`:
- GET `api/users` is used to get all users;
- GET `api/users/${userId}` is used to get one user by `id`;
- POST `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database;
- PUT `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user (**IMPORTANT! The PUT 
request replaces only the specified fields of the object, the rest remain unchanged**);
- DELETE `api/users/${userId}` is used to delete existing user from database.

2. Users are stored as objects that have following properties:
- id — unique identifier (string, uuid) generated on server side;
- username — user's name (string, **required**);
- age — user's age (number, **required**);
- hobbies — user's hobbies (array of strings or empty array, **required**);
